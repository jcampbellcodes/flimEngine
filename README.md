# flimEngine

flimEngine is a game engine I wrote over the course of six months at DePaul University and includes a multithreaded sound engine built on XAudio2 with a built-in scripting engine, 3D collisions, heightmap based terrains, timeline driven custom event callback system, and 3D graphics features. Check out the [docs](https://jcampbellcodes.github.io/flimEngine/) for usage and more details.

## Built With

* Azul - OpenGL 3D graphics framework
* Microsoft XAudio2 - C++ Windows 7+ Audio System API
